Heroes of Gondor
=============

Heroes of Gondor is a Lord of the Rings fan game built in Unity3D, for use in the [Sigma Phi Epsilon Lord of the Rings Booth](http://imgur.com/gallery/XgkcL/) at Carnegie Mellon University Spring Carnival 2014.

As crunch time for Heroes of Gondor wound to a close, this repo got pretty messy. The most up-to-date production branch is currently the NoCrosshair branch, not Main. Also, the game currently requires a 5-minute setup process, a Kinect, a DDR mat, and a staff (yes, a long stick of wood), to play it.

A port for the Unity Web Player is on my to-do list, but in the meantime we release all assets under the MIT license.
